## Introduction 
Atılım University Senior Project SE494

  In this project, it predicts 6 different human activities with three different nonlinear classification models. Accuracy of 0.9915 for SVM, 0.9805 for KNN and 0.9821 
for Rf. The general purpose of Bı classifications is to maximize accuracy and bring the 
prediction value closer to the real value. As a result, SVM with this value of 0.9915, 
absolute accuracy was obtained using the correct parameters. If better parameters are 
found and tested in future plans, the absolute value of 1 can be approached more. These 
parameters can be evaluated with better data sets and used in the testing phase.

## Conclusion
  At the end of the activity classification project, we trained the UCI HAR dataset with 3 
different nonlinear classification models. With metrics, it is possible to infer the prediction rate 
of each model and how each model responds to the dataset. With the GridSearch CV method, 
the accuracy of each model has been increased. The dataset modeled with Random Forest has 
an accuracy rate of 98.23%, with kNN 98.05% and with SVM 99.15% accuracy. As a result, it 
is seen that the model with an accuracy rate of 99.15% learns the mentioned 6 classes better 
than other models.
